  <li><strong>Do Not Share:</strong> Never share your private key with anyone. The private key is the only way to access encrypted information and must be kept absolutely secret.</li>
  <li><strong>Backup:</strong> Make backup copies of both keys and store them in different locations to prevent loss due to hardware failure or unauthorized access.</li>
  <li><strong>Controlled Access:</strong> Make sure that only you have access to the devices or platforms where you store the keys. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.</li>
  <li><strong>Regular Update:</strong> Regularly review and update your storage and security methods to ensure you are using the best practices available.</li>

  <li><strong>Controlled Access:</strong> Make sure that only you have access to the devices or platforms where you store the keys. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.</li>
